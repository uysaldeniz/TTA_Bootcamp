        Authentic Turkish Baklava
        The earliest known recipe from the 2nd century BC that resembles baklava is Ancient Roman placenta cake, a
        honey-covered baked layered-dough dessert which Patrick Faas identifies as the origin of baklava: "The
        Greeks and the Turks still argue over which dishes were originally Greek and which Turkish.
        Baklava of some form is made in many countries today, but it’s Turkey that’s most famous for producing the
        delicacy.
        Great wide sheets of pastry are stretched so thin they become transparent, before being buttered and layered on
        top
        of one another. Pistachios from Gaziantep, Aegean almonds, walnuts or hazelnuts from the Black Sea Region are
        used
        as filling, and sugar syrup rather than honey is poured over after the initial bake.

        Gaziantep is the spiritual home of baklava – particularly those made with pistachios – so much so that Gaziantep
        Baklavası was awarded PGI protection by the EU in 2013. Whole teams of bakers will roll out the sheets, layer
        them
        with the region’s bright green nuts, cut them into diamonds, pour over melted butter then place them in the oven
        before dousing them with syrup and leaving to cool. Because the nuts are so vividly covered, they’re often
        ground
        down to powder to be sprinkled over the top of the baklava, which makes them look all the more tempting. </p>
